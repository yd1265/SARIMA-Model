# SARIMA-Model
SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average )
we will be using a public data set called Air Passenger which recorded the number of passenger
every year from 1949 to 1960. We will apply various techniques to the data set in order to obtain
a good SARIMA model that we will be used for forecasting. The accuracy of model will be tested using RMSE.
